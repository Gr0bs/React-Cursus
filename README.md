# Learning REACT

## :clipboard: **About this project**

This is a video-course of [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/videos) in order to learn React. 
The project is to create a *blog* where we can add, see and delete a blog. 

## :bulb: **Why** 
React is one of the most utilised framework in the front-end environment. So.. If I want to find a job or create usefull website/App, there is no other option then learning React ! 

## :scroll: **Roadmap**
Actually, there is no roadmap beacause the course is finished and I no longer update the project.. This was just for learning !

## :godmode: **About me**
I'm a junior web developer who did a 10 month formation at [BeCode]('http://Becode.org') where I learn to be a web dev. 
I like to create funny stuff during my free time, like extension firefox. I also play *Versus Fighting Games* who push me to always be better en analyze my skills.
